Increase social engagement.

== Description ==

Social widgets today suffer from low engagement, because they are small and they fail to catch the user's attention.

Shareboost integrates with your existing widgets (or creates new ones) and increases engagement using interactive visual methods.

More engagement means more users, more traffic, and more revenues from your website.

Also, using Shareboost on your website is completely free and will always be free.

For more information, go to http://www.shareboost.com
